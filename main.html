                <p>I have registered the domain via godaddy.com. You can log in on godaddy.com with the provided username and password (1). Sorry for that bitch of a password. I tuned the auto-renewel off for the domain, so unless you turn it back on it will only last until next year! Wether you want to keep it or not, please remove the payment method and replace it by a new one, just in case, so I dont get billed, that would be super sweet. You also might need to change the addresss in case you want to keep it. The website is hosted on github. You can log in and edit it via crendetials (2). To do this I had to set up an email account, which you can keep or delete after changing the github and godaddy emails to yours: (3) All the accounts are yours, to keep or to delete</p>
                <p class="ps-note">P.s. have you already tried clicking the Santa?</p>
